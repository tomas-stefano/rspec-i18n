== Refactoring

* Simplified more and more tests!
* Find the right module for the example group specs(it/example) (I think =>
  Spec::Example::ExampleGroupMethods but I think I was wrong)
* Need better hints for the 'its' word

== Future

* Translate shared examples
* Put a #language header in the spec_helper file (Cucumber Style) instead load from config(maintain the two options)
* Create the directory features to test with Cucumber
* Verifying if it's possible to translate error and success messages
* Make the describe/it i18n available from a class 
	
	Example:
	#	class PilhaSpec < Spec::ExampleGroup
	#     descreva Pilha, "sem nenhum elemento"
	#
	#     antes do
	#       @pilha = Pilha.new
	#     end
	#
	#     exemplo "deve lançar um erro no momento do pop" do
	#       lambda { @pilha.pop }.deve mostrar_erro
	#     end
	#
	#   end
	
* Check a better way to manipulating the mocks and stubs for i18n (What do you think?)
* Verify the following matchers: simple_matcher, wrap_expectation, respond_to, change and match_unless_raises.
